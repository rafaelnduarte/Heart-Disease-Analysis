# Exploratory Data Analysis - Heart Diseases

Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)(https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/facts.htm). In the United States, 1 in every 4 deaths is the result of heart disease. Thatâ€™s about 610,000 people who die from the condition each year.


Despite being one of the main causes of death all over the world, about 90% of heart disease cases could have been prevented through simple changes in lifestyle.

There are numerous researches on Machine Learning to build new predictive models that help doctors with the diagnosis of heart diseases.

Studies published in the magazine Nature Biomedical Engineering(https://www.nature.com/natbiomedeng/) show that Deep Learning algorithms were capable of anticipating heart diseases in up to 5 years ahead.

Unquestionably, the use of Artificial Intelligence has deeply impacted the health area and has provided doctors and other health professionals with intelligence data that are becoming even more precise.

This is the objective of this project. Hope you enjoy it!
